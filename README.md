### This repository contains implementations and resources for building recommender systems using various techniques and algorithms.
## Overview

Recommender systems are a subclass of information filtering systems that aim to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item. They are widely used in online platforms to suggest products, movies, music, and other items to users based on their past behavior or preferences.

This repository provides:

- Implementations of popular recommender system algorithms.
- Example datasets for training and testing recommender systems.
- Documentation and tutorials on how to build and evaluate recommender systems.

| Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)    | SVD is a matrix factorization technique that decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into lower-dimensional matrices representing latent factors. It is widely used in collaborative filtering-based recommender systems to capture underlying patterns in user preferences and item characteristics.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Alternating Least Squares (ALS)       | ALS is another matrix factorization method used for collaborative filtering. It iteratively alternates between optimizing user factors and item factors to minimize the reconstruction error. ALS is particularly popular for large-scale recommender systems due to its scalability.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Content-Based Filtering               | Content-based filtering recommends items similar to those a user has liked or interacted with in the past. It relies on item features or attributes to compute item similarity and make recommendations. Content-based methods are beneficial when user-item interactions are sparse or when user preferences can be explicitly modeled.                                                                                                                                       |
| Hybrid Recommender Systems            | Hybrid recommender systems combine multiple recommendation approaches, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and demographic filtering, to improve recommendation accuracy and coverage. By leveraging the strengths of different algorithms, hybrid systems can overcome the limitations of individual methods and provide more diverse and accurate recommendations.                                                                                        |
| Deep Learning-based Recommender Systems | Deep learning techniques, such as neural networks, are increasingly being used to build recommender systems. These models can learn complex patterns and representations from raw data, including user behavior sequences, text, images, and audio. Deep learning-based recommender systems often outperform traditional methods, especially in scenarios with large-scale and high-dimensional data.                                                                                |
| Factorization Machines (FM)           | Factorization Machines are a versatile supervised learning algorithm that can capture interactions between features in high-dimensional sparse datasets. They extend traditional matrix factorization techniques by incorporating feature interactions, making them suitable for recommendation tasks where both user-item interactions and item features are available.                                                                                                               |
| Neighborhood-Based Methods           | Neighborhood-based methods, such as user-based and item-based collaborative filtering, make recommendations by identifying similar users or items based on their past interactions. These methods compute similarities between users or items and recommend items that are liked by similar users or are similar to items the user has interacted with.                                                                                                      |
